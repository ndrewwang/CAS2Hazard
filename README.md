# CAS2Hazard
This Python project takes a CSV with CAS numbers and Sigma-Aldrich URLs for the chemicals in your inventory and scrapes Sigma-Aldrich website to retrieve a compilation of Hazard statements (e.g. H319), Precautionary statements (e.g. P120) and recommendations for Personal Protective Equipment. It outputs (4) HTML files, (1) folder with SDS PDF files and (1) spreadsheet as a result.

Based on original code from: https://github.com/arnauddevie/Hazard-Assessment-CAS-Lookup
